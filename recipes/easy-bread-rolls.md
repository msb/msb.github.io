### Ingredients

* 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
* 7g sachet fast action yeast
* 1 tsp white caster sugar
* 2 tsp fine salt
* 1 tsp sunflower oil, plus extra for the work surface and bowl

### Method

1. Tip the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and oil into a bowl.
Pour over 325ml warm water, then mix (with a spatula or your hand),
until it comes together as a shaggy dough.
Make sure all the flour has been incorporated.
Cover and leave for 10 mins.

2. Lightly oil your work surface and tip the dough onto it.
Knead the dough for at least 10 mins until it becomes tighter and springy â€“
if you have a stand mixer you can do this with a dough hook for 5 mins.
Pull the dough into a ball and put in a clean, oiled bowl.
Leave for 1 hr, or until doubled in size.

3. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a long sausage shape.
Halve the dough, then divide each half into four pieces,
so you have eight equal-sized portions.
Roll each into a tight ball and put on a dusted baking tray,
leaving some room between each ball for rising.
Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 40 mins - 1 hr
or until almost doubled in size.

4. Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8.
When the dough is ready, dust each ball with a bit more flour.
(If you like, you can glaze the rolls with milk or beaten egg, and top with seeds.)
Bake for 25-30mins, until light brown and hollow sounding when tapped on the base.
Leave to cool on a wire rack.
