### Ingredients

* 400g tin black beans, rinsed and drained well
* cooked brown rice 100g from a pouch
* 1 onion, finely chopped or grated
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 25g breadcrumbs
* 1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped

### Method

1. Tip all the ingredients into a blender and pulse until combined. 
Divide into 4 and shape into burger patties. 
Put onto an oiled baking sheet or plate and chill until you need them, 
at least 30 minutes.

2. Heat the barbecue or a griddle pan to high. 
Brush the burger patties with a little olive oil, then put onto the grill. 
Cook for 3 minutes then flip, and cook for 3 minutes more. 
Donâ€™t keep moving the burgers or they will be more likely to break up, 
and you want a good crust on them.
