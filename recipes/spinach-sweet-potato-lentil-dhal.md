### Ingredients

* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 red onion, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove, crushed 
* thumb-sized piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 red chilli, finely chopped
* 1.5 tsp ground turmeric
* 1.5 tsp ground cumin
* 2 sweet potatoes (about 400g/14oz), cut into even chunks
* 250g red split lentils
* 600ml vegetable stock
* 80g bag of spinach
* 4 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal, to serve
* 1/2 small pack of Thai basil, leaves torn, to serve


### Method

1. Heat the oil in a wide-based pan with a tight-fitting lid. 
Add the onion and cook over a low heat for 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until softened. 
Add the garlic, ginger and chilli, cook for 1 min, then add the spices and cook for 1 min more.

2. Turn up the heat to medium, add the sweet potato and stir everything together 
so the potato is coated in the spice mixture. 
Tip in the lentils, stock and some seasoning. 
Bring the liquid to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and cook for 20 mins 
until the lentils are tender and the potato is just holding its shape.

3. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then gently stir in the spinach. 
Once wilted, top with the spring onions and basil to serve. 
Or allow to cool completely, then divide between airtight containers 
and store in the fridge for a healthy lunchbox.
