### Ingredients

* 4 large firm tomatoes, skinned and deseeded (you can use green tomatoes)
* 1 fresh green chilli (the fat squat variety that isn't too fiery), halved and deseeded
* 1/2 medium red onion, finely chopped
* 2 heaped tablespoons chopped fresh coriander
* juice 1 lime
* salt and freshly milled black pepper

### Method

1. First, using a sharp knife, chop the tomatoes into approximately 1/4 inch (5 mm) dice straight into a serving bowl.

You can watch How To Skin and Deseed Tomatoes in our Cookery School Video on the right.

2. Next, chop the chilli very finely before adding it to the tomatoes. 
Add the onion, coriander and lime juice, and season with salt and freshly milled black pepper.

3. Give everything a thorough mixing, then cover and leave on one side for about an hour before serving.
