### Ingredients

* 1 Chinese cabbage (use Savoy as replacement)
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 inch piece ginger, grated
* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 dsp chilli sauce
* 1 tbsp golden caster sugar
* 3 tbsp rice vinegar
* 8 radishes, coarsely grated
* 2 carrots, coarsely grated
* 4 spring onions, shredded

### Method

1. Slice the cabbage into 2.5cm strips. 
Tip into a bowl, mix with 1 tbsp sea salt, then set aside for 1 hr. 
Meanwhile, make the kimchi paste by blending the 
garlic, ginger, fish sauce (if using), chilli sauce, sugar and rice vinegar 
together in a small bowl.

2. Rinse the cabbage under cold running water, drain and dry thoroughly. 
Transfer to a large bowl and toss through the paste, 
along with the radishes, carrot and spring onions. 
Serve straight away or pack into a large jar, 
seal and leave to ferment at room temperature overnight, then chill. 
Will keep in the fridge for up to 2 weeks - the flavour will improve the longer it's left.
