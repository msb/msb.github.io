### Ingredients

* 400g lean turkey mince
* 2 tsp vegetable oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 large carrot, chopped
* 3 celery sticks, chopped
* 250g pack brown mushroom, finely chopped
* pinch of sugar
* 1 tbsp tomato purée
* 2 x 400g cans chopped tomato with garlic & herbs
* 400ml chicken stock, made from 1 low-sodium stock cube


### Method

1. Heat a large non-stick frying pan and dry-fry the turkey mince until browned. 
Tip onto a plate and set aside.

2. Add the oil and gently cook the onion, carrot and celery until softened, 
about 10 mins (add a splash of water if it starts to stick). 
Add the mushrooms and cook for a few mins, then add the sugar and tomato purée, 
and cook for 1 min more, stirring to stop it from sticking.

3. Add the tomatoes, turkey and stock with some seasoning. 
Simmer for at least 20 mins (or longer) until thickened. 
Serve with the pasta and fresh basil, if you have it.
