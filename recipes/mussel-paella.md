### Ingredients

* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onions, chopped medium
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 red pepper, diced
* 1 ripe tomato, skin removed and chopped
* 2 tsp paprika
* salt and black pepper
* 200g calasparra rice (arborio rice is fine)
* 400ml chicken stock
* 700g mussels
* 150g green peas
* small glass white wine

### Method

1. Cook oil and onions in a pan on low heat for 5 minutes.

2. Add the pepper and garlic and cook 5 more minutes.

3. Add the paprika and stir well. Add the rice and stir well, until it is all evenly colored and then add the tomato.

4. Add the stock, increase the heat, and bring to a boil. Stir for around 3 minutes to ensure the rice doesnâ€™t stick
and then reduce the heat.

5. When the rice has swollen and the level of cooking liquid is about even with the rice, and the mussels and peas
and pour the wine evenly over the rice.

6. Place a cover on the pot but leave it slightly ajar. Reduce heat to low and cook until the rice has absorbed 
all the liquid and is starting to make a nice crust on the bottom of the pot (10-15 minutes).
