### Method

1. Drain the chickpeas, add to a large pan with 400ml of water and season.
Bring to the boil, then turn off the heat
and set aside to allow the chickpea flavour to infuse the water.

2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan,
then add the onion mix with 1/2 tsp of salt and cook for 8-10 mins,
until softened.

3. Stir in the spices, and cook for 3 more mins,
adding a splash of the chickpea water to stop them sticking to the bottom of the pan.
Add the tomatoes, squash, and remaining chickpea water and cook for 5 mins.
Tip in the chickpeas. Cook for 10 mins or until the squash are soft.

4. Add the spinach and cook for a further 5 mins.
Season well, add the lemon juice abd extra garam masala to taste.
Scatter with the coriander, to serve.
