### Ingredients

* 450g firm white fish fillets
* 1 egg
* 30g tapioca flour
* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, minced
* 1/2 tbsp red chili, chopped
* 2 spring onions, chopped
* 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp ground black pepper


### Method

1. Preheat oven to 175Â°C.

2. Pat dry the fish fillets with a paper towel. 
With a sharp knife finely chop (almost mince) the fish fillets.

3. Place the chopped fish, egg, tapioca flour, parsley, chilli, 
spring onions, lemon juice, grated ginger, garlic, olive oil, 
salt and pepper in a bowl and use your hand to combine.

4. Line a baking tin with parchment paper. 
Using an ice cream scoop, make small (about 2 inch) balls and set them on the baking tin. 
Slightly flatten the balls with your hands and 
bake on the middle rack for about 20-25 minutes or until lightly golden.
