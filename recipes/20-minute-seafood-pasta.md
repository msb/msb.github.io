* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 garlic clove, chopped

* 300g spaghetti, roughly broken
* 240g pack frozen seafood mix, defrosted
* handful of parsley leaves, chopped, and lemon wedges to serve

### Method

1. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan, 
then cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat for 5 mins until soft. 
Add the paprika, tomatoes and stock, then bring to the boil.

2. Turn down the heat to a simmer, stir in the pasta and cook for 7 mins, 
stirring occasionally to stop the pasta from sticking. 
Stir in the seafood, cook for 3 mins more until itâ€™s all heated through and the pasta is cooked, 
then season to taste. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.
