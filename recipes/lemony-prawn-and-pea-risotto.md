### Ingredients

* 300g bag prawns, defrosted if frozen
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 litre fish stock
* 1 onion, chopped
* 400g risotto rice
* small glass white wine
* 200g frozen peas
* zest and juice 1 lemon

### Method

1. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and
sweat the onions gently for 8-10 mins until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally.
Stir the rice into the onions until completely coated in the oil,
then stir continuously until the rice is shiny and the edges of the grain start to look transparent.

2. Pour in the wine and simmer until totally evaporated.
Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring with each addition until absorbed.
Stir through the prawns, zest and peas with the last ladleful of stock. 

3. The rice should be cooked al dente (with a slightly firm, starchy bite in the middle).
The risotto should be creamy and slightly soupy.
Stir through the lemon juice and some more olive oil.
Let the risotto rest for a few mins, then serve.
