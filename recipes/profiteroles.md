### Ingredients

* 50g butter (preferably unsalted), cut into cubes
* 2 tbsp caster sugar
* 75g strong white flour, sifted with a pinch of fine sea salt
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 300ml double cream
* few drops vanilla extract

For the sauce
* 50g cocoa powder
* 175g caster sugar

### Method

1. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. To make the profiteroles,
put the butter and 2 tsp of the caster sugar in a saucepan with 150ml water.
Place the pan over a low heat until the butter and sugar have melted,
then bring to the boil.
Take off the heat, add the flour all at once and beat energetically with a wooden spoon
until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan.

2. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then beat in the eggs bit by bit until you have a stiff,
glossy mixture (this process is much easier in a food processor).
Rinse two baking trays with cold water,
shaking off any excess so they are slightly damp (this helps the pastry to rise).
Using 2 teaspoons, spoon blobs of the mixture onto the baking trays.
Then place in the oven and cook for about 18-20 mins until well risen and brown.
Remove the profiteroles from the oven
and cut a small slit in the base of each one so they don’t collapse.
Cool on a wire rack.

3. When they’re cold, whip the cream lightly until just holding its shape.
Sweeten to taste with remaining sugar and a few drops of vanilla extract.
Cut the profiteroles in half, fill them with the sweetened cream and pile them up on a plate.
You can refrigerate them for 1-2 hrs at this point
but not for any longer as the pastry will go soggy.

4. To make the sauce, sift the cocoa powder into a bowl.
Put the sugar in a pan with 100ml water and warm over a low heat until dissolved.
Bring to the boil, cook for 1 min, then pour over the cocoa powder
and stir well until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan,
cook for 1 min then set aside for 15 mins before drizzling over the profiteroles.
