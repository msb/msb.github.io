* 225g packet of king prawns
* 400ml almond milk (or alternative) with a few drops of coconut essence
* 250ml vegetable stock
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* Vegetables as desired. (Nigella uses frozen peas, green beans and soya beans. I used mangetout and baby sweetcorn.)

3. Add the prawns and cook for a couple of minutes

4. Add veggies, stock, 'coconut' milk, and fish sauce
