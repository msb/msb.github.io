### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 onions chopped
* most of a head of celery chopped
* 2 large carrots chopped
* 4 clove garlic crushed
* 500g lentils cooked
* salt and freshly ground black pepper
* white rice for serving optional

### Method

1. To cook lentils, bring 2 litres of water and 500g of lentils (picked over and stones removed) to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes or until lentils reach desired tenderness. Drain well.

2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil until shimmering. Add onion, celery, and carrots and cook until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.

3. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add lentils and stir until uniformly combined and heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm plain or over rice.
