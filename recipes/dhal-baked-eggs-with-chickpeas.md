### Ingredients

* Oil, to fry
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped
* pinch of dried chilli flakes, plus extra to sprinkle
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
* 150g red split lentils
* 100ml passata
* 600ml vegetable stock
* 400g tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 4 large eggs

### Method

1. Heat a splash of oil in a casserole dish or large, non-stick frying pan
(that has a lid) over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and 1/2 tsp salt and fry for 5 mins,
until softened and just starting to brown.

2. Add garlic and fry for 1 min, until fragrant,
then add the spices and fry for 1 min more.

3. Rinse the lentils well in a large sieve under cold running water.
Drain and add to the pan, stirring until heated through.

4. Stir in the passata and stock. Turn up the heat and bring to the boil,
then reduce heat and simmer for 35-40 min, stirring occasionally,
until almost all of the liquid is absorbed and the lentils are tender.
Check seasoning.

5. Stir in chickpeas. Using a wooden spoon,
make four wells in the lentil mixture and crack in the eggs.
Cover with the lid and cook for 4-5 min,
or until the egg whites are set and the yolks are still runny.
Sprinkle over some dried chilli flakes and freshly ground black pepper.
