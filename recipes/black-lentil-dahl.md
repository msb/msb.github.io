### Ingredients

* 4 tbsp oil
* 2 onions, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, crushed
* 2 thumbs fresh ginger, grated
* 3 tsp turmeric
* 3 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tbsp garam masala
* 1 red chili, finely chopped
* 500g dry black/brown lentils
* 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* 2l vegetable stock

### Method

1. Add the oil to a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the onions and garlic to the pan.
Peel and grate the ginger and add it in along with the chili and spices.
Cook for a few minutes until the onion is soft. Donâ€™t let them brown.

2. Pour in the lentils and chopped tomatoes and mix everything together. Then add in the vegetable stock. 
Bring to a simmer and let it simmer gently for about 45 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked.
If using tinned lentils, they will be ready quicker but you might want to keep simmering so that it reduces more.

3. Season with salt and pepper and serve with coconut/greek yoghurt and herbs.
